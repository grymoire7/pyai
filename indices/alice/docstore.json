Oh dear!\nI shall be too late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her\nthat she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite\nnatural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-\npocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it\n\ufb02ashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a\nwaistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity ,\nshe ran across the \ufb01eld after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a\nlar ge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed\nto be a very deep well.\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty\nof time as she went down to look about her , and to wonder what was going\nto happen next.
